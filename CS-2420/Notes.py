# Midterm Test Study
# 1. what is the log2 of this number (130 000 000) = 27
# 2. what is the log4 of 1000 = 5 (4^what = 1000)
# 3. story problem with exponents
# 4. What is Big O analysis                                                                                                             = Categorizing algorithms to show work increase as size increases
# 5. When is Big O analysis not important                                                                                               = When the data really small and we know its going to stay small
# 6. Which Big O category does this code use?
# for N
#   for N
#       for N
#           Do N^2 work
#       for N
#   for N
# for N
#   for N
# Answer = N^5 (Drop Constants
# 7. List 5 Big O Categories and an algorithm that uses it
# 8. Given this set of 8 numbers what will the data look like after 1 pass
# 9. know best, expected, worse case scenario for all algorithms (7 algorithms) could ask about swaps
# 10. If you have inefficient code/bottleneck where should you look first to fix it = Wherever the worst big O is
# 11. What happens to the speed of execution if you make all the code that is
#        NOT the bottleneck code go a 1000 times faster = Nothing
# 12. Why is it more likely that factoring can become P over SAT = its not NP Complete
# 13. Big table of 7 algorithms
# 14. convert this infix exp to postfix
# 15. given postfix string eval this expression
# 16. write code for bubble sort
# 17. write pop code (could be any code from)
